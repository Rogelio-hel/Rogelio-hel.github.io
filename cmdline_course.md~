## Command Line Tools for Linguists (KIK-LG219)

This very intense course took place on the second period of the Autumn Semester. I was interested in improving my language technology skills, in view of its growing application to language research in general. What I discovered is that UNIX environment allows for very complex operations in all areas, and that automation of these processes can be of great help for the researcher.

The course favored a very practical approach, so that we could experiment each week with different features of the command line environment. I thought it was a humorous idea to state as one of the course's objectives "stay calm and google when things go wrong", but in the end this is really one of the most valuable skills learned; since the knowledge in this area is constantly changing and improving, and there is an infinity of issues that can go wrong, it only makes sense to learn to put the appropriate search items in google and to interpret them.

The material was mostly presented online, as videos or reading material, but the weekly lab sessions turned out to be essential to solve some of the problems that we run into.
